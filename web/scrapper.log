Performance wise to hatssoff. Looks are stunning, camera awesome.Sierra blue is very light shade.  Silver and this not much difference.I got it on 25th sept Very fast delivery!! Battery is quite good stays one full day with moderate use.'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Lokesh  Behera ', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Must buy!', 'Comment': "Well, I'll say I'm really impressed by the design. The look and the hold of this phone is great and sleek. Camera bump is li'l large as compared to others, but there will be no complain about the camera quality. Smooth 120hz display. Speakers perfect no doubt. Li'l bit in heavier side as compared to iphone 12.   The phone looks amazing. If you have good budget then just go for it."}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Akash Karmakar', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Mind-blowing purchase', 'Comment': 'Finally the best purchase of this season. Awesome colour, great performance and stunning looks. Camera module is massive and performance as well.'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Krishna Ashok', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Brilliant', 'Comment': 'Performance is nowhere comparable.Camera quality can be debatable you have other choices with much lesser cost.Video quality is undeniably the best , none can surpass the standards.Battery performance is something which they have definitely worked on and it’s awesome . Overall it’s an amazing phone , but is it worth spending a lakh , that is debatable again.'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Flipkart Customer', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Excellent', 'Comment': 'In love with the phone. The night pictures and videos  that come out of the phone are too good. Upgraded from 12 mini. Not a huge difference in camera but night pictures are definitely an upgrade. The battery life is exceptional. Often use it as hotspot for around  6 hrs and after more than 10 hours, battery is more than 60% if other apps are not heavily used. 120hz feels super smooth. Cons: Price is still very high'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Neeraj Trikha', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Wonderful', 'Comment': 'I moved to 13 Pro from an 11 Pro and this new phone is amazing. The cameras are better, battery life is much improved and I like this new design.And the 120hz screen, which is way brighter, is a delight to see and scroll through.Flipkart delivered the phone ahead of schedule (as always).'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'SANJU Das', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Terrific purchase', 'Comment': 'The iPhone 13 Pro is a great phone. It has a lot of features that are very useful, including a great camera, a powerful processor, and a lot of storage. The battery life is also very good, and the phone is very fast. The only downside is that the phone is a bit expensive, but it is definitely worth the price.'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Amit Tanwar', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Mind-blowing purchase', 'Comment': 'Superb phone when I opened , build quality is as good as Apple is know .Still heating is observed when I started and connected to WiFi within 5-10 min.Rest camera is superb . Cinematic video is excellent .Touch is so smooth .Good as compare to 12 pro.'}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Flipkart Customer', 'Rating': '5', 'CommentHead': 'Wonderful', 'Comment': "As usual classic Apple, if you are planning to switch from any iphone older than 11 gen then opt for the pro model, pro max would be humongous in size. Camera and display are same but if you have large fingers and need battery to last 2 days with normal use then go for the max model.Opt for 256gb model as the promotion is only available in 4k for 256 and above model, it's available in 1080p for 128gb models."}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Abid Hussain', 'Rating': '4', 'CommentHead': 'Really Nice', 'Comment': "Price is high but when it comes to hand we forget everything about it's price because it's too awesome and cool iphone.... you can go for it it's really a beautiful set or you can say a full damaka product......"}, {'Product': 'iphone13pro', 'Name': 'Abid Hussain', 'Rating': 'No Rating', 'CommentHead': 'No Comment Heading', 'Comment': "Price is high but when it comes to hand we forget everything about it's price because it's too awesome and cool iphone.... you can go for it it's really a beautiful set or you can say a full damaka product......"}]
